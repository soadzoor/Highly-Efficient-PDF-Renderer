# Changelog

User-facing changes are recorded here, following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Add notes under `Unreleased` alongside the implementation. Release automation
moves those notes into a dated version section and uses them for the GitHub Release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Render embedded PFA/PFB Type1 glyph outlines with their original encodings,
  replacing substitute-font approximations when the source font is supported.
- Expand CFF/Type2 support with Expert encodings, Type1 charstrings, synthetic
  font inheritance and Multiple Master interpolation. Add CFF2 variation support;
  PDF conversion uses the embedded font's default variation instance.
- Support more embedded font programs through a font-local PostScript
  interpreter, including computed font data, custom OtherSubrs, streams and
  filters, sampled images, masks, tiling patterns and mesh shadings. Retain
  supported geometry and image assets through HEP export and reload.
- Support font-local CIE and spot colors, color-rendering dictionaries, and JPEG,
  CCITT, JBIG2 and JPX decoding. Apply supplied `DefaultCMYK` or embedded CMYK
  output-intent profiles to supported paints for calibrated display output.
- Add an `embeddedFontPaint: "font"` compatibility option for intrinsic Type1/CFF
  stroked fonts. The default continues to follow the PDF text rendering mode.
- Add curated changelogs, release-note validation and GitHub Releases generated
  from the same notes shipped in the npm package.

### Fixed

- Recover JPEG images with otherwise usable `/Blend` decode parameters instead
  of rejecting their pages.
- Recover layer references omitted from the PDF catalog's optional-content group
  list, retaining diagnostics and layer visibility behavior.
- Read updated cross-reference data in linearized PDFs.
- Remove white seams between mesh shading triangles in the Canvas2D renderer,
  while retaining vector mesh geometry in HEP files.
- Preserve more font-local image interpolation, composite glyph state,
  transformed paints, nonunit CIE shading ranges and CMYK profile information.
- Build releases after the version bump so the viewer displays the new version.

### Upgrade notes and limitations

- Reconvert source PDFs to benefit from restored embedded-font outlines and
  other conversion improvements. Existing HEP files retain the geometry and
  assets saved by their original converter.
- Original glyph appearance and Unicode mapping are independent. Missing
  Unicode mappings can still affect search and copied text, even when the glyph
  renders correctly; embedding font outlines does not reconstruct those mappings.
- Unsupported font programs retain diagnosed fallback where possible. This is a
  font-local interpreter, not a general PostScript or physical printer engine.
  Remaining JPX palette/channel mappings, multiple alpha planes, mixed precision,
  more than four codestream components, transparent or high-dimensional spot
  shadings, and physical press calibration are tracked in the
  [follow-up checklist](docs/development.md#font-local-postscript-follow-ups).
