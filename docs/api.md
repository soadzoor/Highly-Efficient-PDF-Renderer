# API reference

[Overview](../README.md) · [Examples](examples.md) · [Manual](manual.md)

This page covers the main integration APIs. The package ships TypeScript declarations;
[the public entry point](../src/index.ts) lists every exported function and type.

## Package entry points

| Import | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@soadzoor/hepr` | Three.js objects, HEP export, search, selection, LOD utilities, and room detection. |
| `@soadzoor/hepr/three` | Alias for the main entry point, with the same exports. |
| `@soadzoor/hepr/node` | Node file sources, PDF worker sessions, and bundled standard-font resolution. |
| `@soadzoor/hepr/experimental/pdf-worker` | Worker entry used by the PDF session infrastructure. |
| `@soadzoor/hepr/experimental/dense-pdf-worker` | Worker entry for the specialized dense-vector parser. |

## `pdfObjectGenerator(source, options?, rendererType?)`

Returns `Promise<HeprThreePdfObject>`. The result is a `THREE.Group` that follows
your Three.js camera through its render hooks. Add it to your scene and render
normally; frame the camera using the object's bounds as shown in the [examples](examples.md).

```ts
import { pdfObjectGenerator } from "@soadzoor/hepr";

const pdf = await pdfObjectGenerator("/drawings/plan.pdf", {
  pages: "1-3, 5",
  onProgress: ({ value, stage }) => console.log(value, stage)
});
scene.add(pdf);
```

`source` accepts PDF or HEP bytes as `Uint8Array` / `ArrayBuffer`, a `File` /
`Blob`, a fetchable URL or browser-relative path, a base64 payload, or a data URL.
For local files in Node, read the file into bytes before calling the shared APIs.

`rendererType` is the **third argument**: `"webgl"` (default) or `"webgpu"`.
Use `"webgpu"` with a WebGPU-capable Three.js renderer and browser/GPU support.

### Loading options

| Option | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signal` | — | `AbortSignal` for source reading, parsing, LOD preparation, and object creation. |
| `sourceKind` | `"auto"` | Infer the format from the source, or force `"pdf"` / `"hep"`. |
| `pages` | All pages | One-based PDF pages: `"2"`, `"1-3, 5"`, `"5-"`, or `"-3"`. |
| `maxPagesPerRow` | Automatic grid | Maximum pages per row when composing a PDF scene. |
| `segmentMerge` | `true` | Merge compatible adjacent vector stroke segments during PDF parsing. |
| `invisibleCull` | `true` | Drop known invisible content during PDF parsing. |
| `pdfFastPath` | `"auto"` | Try the specialized dense-vector parser; `"off"` uses the full parser. |
| `extractText` | `false` | Also populate scene-space text items for tasks such as room-label seeding. |
| `onProgress` | — | Receive overall progress (`value` from 0 to 1) and the current `stage`. |

Page selections are deduplicated and composed in document order. Invalid selections
reject with `RangeError`. HEP files preserve their saved page selection and layout;
PDF parsing options do not reprocess a HEP scene. Search uses the text index and
does not require `extractText: true`.

See [loading option types](../src/pdfObjectGenerator.ts) and
[progress fields and stages](../src/loadProgress.ts). All selected pages are
prepared before the promise resolves. Cancellation is cooperative; after a
successful load, the returned object belongs to the caller and needs disposal.

### Rendering options

| Option | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vectorLod` | `"auto"` | Use stroke LOD for large scenes; `"off"` keeps exact strokes, `"force"` enables it below the usual threshold. |
| `textLod` | `"auto"` | Simplify subpixel text clusters; `"off"` keeps exact glyphs. |
| `curveStrokes` | `true` | Enable curve-aware stroke joins and caps where supported. |
| `vectorOnly` | `false` | Use vector glyph geometry instead of the raster glyph atlas. |
| `pageBackground` | `"#ffffff"` | Page background color. |
| `pageBackgroundOpacity` | `1` | Page background alpha, from 0 to 1. |
| `vectorOverrideColor` | `"#000000"` | Color used to tint or replace vector colors. |
| `vectorOverrideOpacity` | `0` | Override strength: 0 preserves original colors, 1 replaces them. |
| `threeColorCompositing` | `"linear"` | Three/WebGPU alpha-compositing domain; `"display"` requires `renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.LinearSRGBColorSpace`. |

Colors accept hex strings, numbers such as `0xffffff`, or normalized RGB tuples
such as `[1, 1, 1]`. See [rendering option types](../src/threePdfObject.ts).

## `HeprThreePdfObject`

The object supports normal Three.js transforms. `sceneData` contains its parsed
`VectorScene`; treat it as read-only. `sourceLabel`, `sourceKind`, and
`rendererType` describe the loaded source and backend.

| Member | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `hasSearchableText` | Whether the scene has searchable indexed text. |
| `searchText(query, options?)` | Return matches with scene-space and object-local bounds. |
| `setSearchHighlights(matches, { currentIndex }?)` | Highlight matches and emphasize the active one; `null` clears them. |
| `setTextSelectionHighlights(rects)` | Draw scene-space `Bounds[]` or packed `Float32Array` selection rectangles; `null` clears them. |
| `clientToScenePoint(camera, x, y, element)` | Map client CSS pixels to PDF scene coordinates; may return `null`. |
| `sceneToClientPoint(camera, x, y, element)` | Project PDF scene coordinates to client CSS pixels; may return `null`. |
| `setVectorLodMode(mode)` / `setTextLodMode(mode)` | Change LOD at runtime. |
| `setPageBackgroundColor(r, g, b, alpha)` | Set normalized page background components. |
| `setVectorColorOverride(r, g, b, opacity)` | Set normalized vector override components. |
| `getVectorStrokeLodStats()` / `getTextLodStats()` | Inspect LOD statistics; may return `null` before data is available. |
| `prepareFrameForThreeRenderer(renderer, camera)` | Explicit preparation for advanced render pipelines; ordinary loops synchronize automatically. |
| `dispose()` | Release owned GPU resources, textures, geometry, and event listeners. |

Remove the object from its parent when disposing it:

```ts
pdf.removeFromParent();
pdf.dispose();
```

`attachControls()`, `fitToBounds()`, and `setViewState()` manage the internal
fallback viewport. In an ordinary Three.js integration, use your application's
camera and controls. Full method contracts: [HeprThreePdfObject](../src/threePdfObject.ts).

## `buildHep(input, options?)`

Returns `Promise<Blob>` with MIME type `application/x-hep`. Save it with a `.hep`
extension. Import it from `@soadzoor/hepr` in either a browser or Node.

| Input | Options |
| --- | --- |
| PDF source (`PdfObjectSource`) | `BuildHepFromPdfOptions`: shared encoding options, `pages`, `maxPagesPerRow`, `segmentMerge`, and `invisibleCull`. |
| Parsed `VectorScene` | `BuildHepFromSceneOptions`: shared encoding options, optional `sourcePdf` and `sourcePdfPages` for image fallback. |

Shared encoding options are `sourceLabel`, `encodeRasterImages` (default `true`),
`compression` (`"deflate"` by default, or `"store"`), `onProgress`, and `signal`.
Compressed writing requires native `CompressionStream("deflate")`; loading
compressed files requires `DecompressionStream("deflate")`.

Pass an already-loaded `pdf.sceneData` to avoid parsing again. `sourcePdf` is
needed only when the scene reports PDF image operations but has no extracted
raster layers; provide the matching `sourcePdfPages` if pages were selected.

Node hosts can install the optional `@napi-rs/canvas` backend for PDF operations
that need Canvas2D, image encoding, and encoded HEP image decoding. See the
[conversion examples](examples.md), [builder types](../src/hepBuilder.ts), and
[HEP format specification](HEP_CONTAINER.md).

## Search and selection

`pdf.searchText(query, { caseSensitive, maxMatches })` defaults to
case-insensitive matching with a 5,000-match limit. Whitespace matches across
line breaks. Results use zero-based composed `pageIndex` values and UTF-16 text
offsets. Use `localBounds` for navigation in the object's local space, and
`highlightBounds` / `localHighlightBounds` for tight rectangles around wrapped hits.

For a custom scene pipeline, `createSceneTextSearcher(scene)` returns a searcher
with `hasText` and `search(query, options?)`. `createTextSearchController(options)`
adds query state and next/previous navigation for native renderer integrations.
See [search contracts](../src/textSearch.ts).

`createTextSelectionController(options)` adds mouse and touch selection, copy,
and selection overlays. Supply `getCanvas` and a `TextSelectionAdapter` that
exposes the scene, coordinate conversions, and highlight drawing. The optional
`setCameraInteractionEnabled` adapter callback coordinates selection with camera controls.

Call `updateOverlay()` after rendering to position touch handles and the copy
popup, `refreshHighlights()` after switching backends, and `dispose()` on teardown.
The controller also provides `enable()`, `disable()`, `clearSelection()`,
`getSelectedText()`, and asynchronous `copySelection()`. See the
[selection adapter and controller types](../src/textSelection.ts) and
[integration examples](examples.md).

Both features use the scene's text index in PDF and HEP documents. Text geometry
helpers `computeCharQuad` and `computeCharRangeBounds` are also exported;
their coordinate and buffer contracts are in [sceneTextGeometry.ts](../src/sceneTextGeometry.ts).

## `detectRooms(scene, options?)`

Returns `Promise<RoomDetectionResult>`. The detector loads on first use and requires
Web Worker support in browsers. Non-browser environments without `Worker` run it
on the calling thread.

Pass `pageIndexes` to select zero-based scene pages, `seeds` for explicit seed
points, `signal` to cancel, or `collectDebugInfo: true` for diagnostics. Enable
`extractText` when loading a PDF to supply room-label text items; HEP scenes use
their saved text index as a seed source.

Results include `rooms` and `failedSeeds`. Each room provides a flat `polygon`
coordinate array, `area` in scene units squared, `labelText`, `roomNumber`, and
`hasDoorEvidence`. Thresholds and wall-detection controls are described in the
[room detection types](../src/roomDetector.ts); see also [quality and evaluation](room-detector-quality.md).

## Node sessions and native viewer integration

The [Node entry](../src/nodePdfSource.ts) exports `createNodeFilePdfSource(path,
options?)` for random-access local-file reads, `openPdfInNodeWorker(source,
options?)` for a PDF parser session, and `createNodeBundledStandardFontResolver(options?)`
for lazy bundled font loading. Close worker sessions with `await session.close()`;
close a file source yourself if it is never handed to a session. Session options
and methods are defined in [workerClient.ts](../src/pdf/workerClient.ts) and
[nativeTypes.ts](../src/pdf/nativeTypes.ts).

The standalone native viewer is a repository application. Its renderer classes
are source modules, not named exports from the npm entry point. Use
[main.ts](../src/main.ts) as the integration example and
[RendererApi](../src/rendererTypes.ts) as the backend contract for
[WebGL](../src/webGlFloorplanRenderer.ts) and [WebGPU](../src/webGpuFloorplanRenderer.ts).
The exported `createCanvasInteractionController(getRenderer)` attaches native
pan/zoom controls; its lifecycle is documented in [canvasInteractions.ts](../src/canvasInteractions.ts).
